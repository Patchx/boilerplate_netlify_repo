## Netlify Deploy settings

Repository:  **Your GitHub link here**
    
Base directory:  **Not set**

Build command:  **npm run build**

Publish directory:  **build**

## Don't edit anything in the build folder, because it gets rebuilt on deploy

## Running Tests

- Important! Currently, the tests will fail if the local dev server isn't running on your machine. Make sure you ran ```npm run local``` before running ```npm run test```
